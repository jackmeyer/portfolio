# Jack Meyer

Hey, I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Charles Schwab. My primary experiences are are with Xamarin iOS/Android app development, React.JS web apps, .NET APIs, and both SQL and MongoDB databases. I have also worked on projects involving:
- Microsoft SharePoint and Power Automate
- CI/CD Deployments with Bamboo and PCF
- SQL scripting and stored procedures
- and more...

It won't take you long to notice that technology rules my life, and I am constantly planning/working on DIY projects that keep me busy and inspired. I started early in childhood flashing [custom firmwares](https://dd-wrt.com/) to boost the signal of our home router, 
software modding our original Xbox, and demanding the best out of any device I got my hands on. Consumer technology has always had my heart, and my focus has now turned to improving the home. Check out my projects page to learn more about my custom-built
smart mirror, [waterproof shower TV](/posts/showertv), and soon: 2.5Gbe home networking with a server for NAS/Virtualization/Docker containers.

Want to read some fun facts?
 - I've been typing at [100+ wpm](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/race_history?user=jacktothemeyer&n=50&startDate=) since I started high school
 - At age 14, I spent 5 hours alone at Fry's (RIP) building my first PC
 - Left-handed
 - Extensive knowledge of NBA players/history
 - There's hardly a device I own that I haven't explored in some way. Yes, even the [Roomba](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980).
